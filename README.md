# CrowdCoin
 This is a study project, the idea is to create a kickstart clone powered by the Ethereum blockchain, an intelligent contract is responsible for managing all fundraising rules.
 
 ## What can be done
 It is possible to create a new campaign (this will generate a new smart contract), you can donate to a specific campaign that was created previously, the campaign creator can make spending requests, as a campaign donor you can approve or deny the spending request, the request must have more than 50% approval to be successful.
 
 ### Technologies
  In this project was used ReactJS, NextJS, Web3, Metamask and ethereum blockchain (Solidity) to generate smart contracts, for more details view the package.json
